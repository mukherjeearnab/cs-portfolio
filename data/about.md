Iâ€™m a 4th year _Computer Science_ Ph.D. scholar at **IIT Patna**, working under the guidance of Dr. Raju Halder. Before I continue, let me state how wildly narcissistic it is that I, along with most academics, have these self-aggrandizing websites. Now, back to me! My research direction is primarily developing secure and resilient applications using Blockchain Technology while leveraging the power of language tools and related technologies. I am also fascinated with exploring and solving cryptographic and big-data challenges. Overall research interests include:

-   Exploring how blockchain technology might help make existing systems more resilient, secure, and immutable.
-   Developing interoperable and interconnected blockchain-based applications.
-   Improving privacy and security aspects of federated systems, introducing modular access control paradigms.
-   Verification of Smart contracts using formal methods.

Beyond my research, I enjoy reading novels, writing poems, and turning potential waste items into beautiful artworks.
